# Problem 6.5 Jugs of Water.
## Question.
You have a five-quart juv, a three-quart juv, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs and oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.



## Brute Force
Fill the 5 quart jug completely and pour it into the 3 quart jug, then, just 2 quarts water are left in the 5quart jug
After that, empty the 3 quart jug and pour the remaining 2 quart water from the 5 quart jug into the empty 3 quart jug. 
Then again fill the water fully into the 5 quart jug, and again pour it into the 3quart jug which already has 2 quart water. Since it just need 1 quart to be full, 5 quart jug now has 4 quarts left
