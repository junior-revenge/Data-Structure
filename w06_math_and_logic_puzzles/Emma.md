# Problem 6.5 Jugs of Water.
## Question.
You have a five-quart juv, a three-quart juv, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs and oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.
